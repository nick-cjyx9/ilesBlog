<p>Views on human age need to be revisited. The value of adulthood as a period of certainty has declined for many, which means that this period is being delayed. The processes of personality development vary, and adults are preserving signs of infantilism.</p>

<p>The traditional life periodization by age ‘child – young person – adult’ is not quite relevant today. Too many things have changed: the pace of life, <a href="https://iq.hse.ru/en/news/177664405.html" rel="nofollow">approaches to education</a>, social roles and <a href="https://iq.hse.ru/en/news/177668044.html" rel="nofollow">institutions</a>, <a href="https://iq.hse.ru/en/news/177665667.html" rel="nofollow">marriage</a>, and professional identity. People’s life courses have become <a href="https://iq.hse.ru/en/news/177666804.html" rel="nofollow">less predictable</a>. The beginning of adult life has changed. Finally, the value of adulthood is being questioned, and infantilism is becoming a common phenomenon. In their paper <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10609393.2018.1436297" rel="nofollow">Infantilism: Theoretical Construct andOperationalization</a>, Elena Sabelnikova and Natalia Khmeleva suggest a new conceptualization for this phenomenon, in which they emphasize that they avoided a ‘judgmental modus’ but analysed the phenomenon of infantilism as such.</p>
<h2 id="delayed-self-identity" class="heading"><a href="#delayed-self-identity" class="heading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for Delayed Self-identity" tabindex="-1"></a>Delayed Self-identity</h2>
<p>From a psychological perspective, adulthood implies self-regulation, emotional maturity (rationality, self-control, lack of impulsivity, etc.), responsibility, ability to self-reflect, and the need to work and have stable relationships. Adults strive for success in their professions and in family life. Some psychologists emphasize the importance of the motives of affiliation and achievement. It is important for a person to define his or her civil and social position, lifestyle, etc.</p>
<p>According to Sabelnikova and Khmeleva, infantile personality, on the contrary, is characterized by immature feelings (‘childish’ reactions, lack of willpower, lack of confidence), external locus of control (other people are blamed), inflated self-concept, low demands on self (accompanied by high demands on society), and egocentrism. ‘An infantile person seeks to escape the need to adequately assess objective social reality’, the paper’s authors added.</p>
<p>In other words, maturity is associated with successful mastering of the key social roles: professional, spousal, and parental. But more and more people are delaying this choice, and valuing it differently. People <a href="https://iq.hse.ru/en/news/177665223.html" rel="nofollow">are spending more time in search of themselves and are taking longer to get an education and choose a partner</a>. As a result, the process of professional and personal identification is taking longer.</p>
<h2 id="age-boundaries-are-relative" class="heading"><a href="#age-boundaries-are-relative" class="heading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for Age Boundaries Are Relative" tabindex="-1"></a>Age Boundaries Are Relative</h2>
<p><a href="https://iq.hse.ru/en/news/177665223.html" rel="nofollow">Demographic data</a> show that the age of separation from the parents’ family has shifted from 18-20 in older generations (for example, among Russians born in the 1950s) to 23-25 for those born during the 1980s baby boom.</p>
<p>Almost one-third of the generation born between 1980 and 1986 believe that they rushed into independence too early. ‘On the one hand, we can assume that 70% of the younger respondents had made a well thought out decision since they are sure they started off on their own at the right time for them’, said demographers Alina Dolgova and Ekaterina Mitrofanova. ‘However, a fairly large and growing proportion had apparently taken the decision lightly and later regretted it’.</p>
<p>Periodization of ages has varied in different studies. Adulthood has different names: maturity, personal agency stage, middle age, etc. Some researchers, including American psychologists Grace Craig and Don Baucum, suggest talking about ‘early adulthood’ between 18 and 40. Other scholars, such as American psychologist Virginia Quinn, define the same period as ‘young age’. According to Sabelnikova and Khmeleva, this is the main period of self-realization</p>
<h2 id="infantilism-factors" class="heading"><a href="#infantilism-factors" class="heading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for Infantilism Factors" tabindex="-1"></a>Infantilism Factors</h2>
<p>Delaying adulthood is a response to the new reality, many scholars believe. Everything is changing, from the set of competencies and jobs (some of them are disappearing while the others are evolving), to <a href="https://iq.hse.ru/en/news/177668044.html" rel="nofollow">relationships</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://iq.hse.ru/data/2018/05/21/1149601241/settings-gears.svg" style="width:21px;display:inline-block"> A number of new ‘ways to live’ have been discovered. Alternative models of adulthood have evolved. <a href="https://iq.hse.ru/en/news/177666804.html" rel="nofollow">People's life courses have become unpredictable</a>. For example, people earn a degree, work, and then study again and change their profession. People can leave their parents’ home, but then come back and extend their ‘childhood’. Meanwhile, the range of life opportunities is too wide, which can be disorienting and make it difficult to make a choice.</p>
<p><img src="https://iq.hse.ru/data/2018/05/21/1149601241/settings-gears.svg" style="width:21px;display:inline-block"> Educational choices have an ‘unknown expiration date’ (due to the unclear future of professions) and, according to psychologist Alexandra Bochaver, cause lack of confidence. As a result, young people tend to become escapist and delay important decisions. Instead of choosing a strategy, they limit themselves to tactical solutions in various spheres of life and delay their final (‘adult’) choices.</p>
<p><img src="https://iq.hse.ru/data/2018/05/21/1149601241/settings-gears.svg" style="width:21px;display:inline-block"> Conditions for socialization have changed. Communication has largely gone online, and is mediated by digital technology and devices: gadgets, mobile apps, social media, messengers, etc. But such contacts are superficial, Sabelnikova and Khmeleva believe. Some studies have shown that when live communication is replaced with digital communication, empathy decreases and ‘autistic-like behaviour’ grows (self-absorption, escaping reality). This leads to emotional immaturity.</p>
<p><img src="https://iq.hse.ru/data/2018/05/21/1149601241/settings-gears.svg" style="width:21px;display:inline-block"> The sociocultural environment has also changed, and traditional roles are being devalued. ‘The goal “to be happy” is being replaced with the goal “to be successful”’, Sabelnikova and Khmeleva write. ‘Many values are getting a “not” prefix: not to get married, <a href="https://iq.hse.ru/en/news/177666845.html" rel="nofollow">not to have children</a>, since the old patriarchal values will be an obstacle for contemporary young people who are willing to become successful by all means’.</p>
<p>With all these powerful changes of environment, infantilization looks like a logical phenomenon.</p>
<p>In addition, some types of activities also impact the coming-of-age process. For example, according to Virginia Quinn, long studies (Master’s, doctoral, continuing education) somewhat slow the process of growing up. Such people often live with their parents and are not willing to get a job and earn an income.</p>
<h2 id="peter-pan-prince-eternal-boy" class="heading"><a href="#peter-pan-prince-eternal-boy" class="heading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for Peter Pan, Prince, Eternal Boy" tabindex="-1"></a>Peter Pan, Prince, Eternal Boy</h2>
<p>Psychologists have studied the signs of infantilism from various perspectives. Jeffrey Arnett, author of the <a href="http://www.jeffreyarnett.com/articles.htm" rel="nofollow">Emerging Adulthood</a> theory (2000), outlined a special age period from 18 to 25. Young people of this age are no longer teenagers, but they are not adults yet. They are only partly independent, since they usually live with parents. Such young people have a lot of opportunities and few responsibilities. Before choosing a partner or a vocation, they can try different options several times.</p>
<p><img src="https://iq.hse.ru/data/2018/05/21/1149601241/settings-gears.svg" style="width:21px;display:inline-block"> Carl Gustav Jung provided a psychoanalytical analysis of this phenomenon. Speaking about the ‘eternal boy’ archetype (puer aeternus), he meant people avoiding adult responsibility.</p>
<p><img src="https://iq.hse.ru/data/2018/05/21/1149601241/settings-gears.svg" style="width:21px;display:inline-block"> Jung’s peer Marie-Louise von Franz developed these ideas in her book ‘Eternal Boy. Puer Aeternus’. She looked at a particular form of neurosis in such people: a ‘provisional life’.</p>
<p>A man suffering this neurosis feels that he doesn’t exist yet in real life. In his search for a partner, a job, or a vocation he constantly feels that this is not what he wants. The state of ‘provisional life’ may linger on: an ‘eternal boy’ starts avoiding living in the present. As a result, he may acquire addictions, anger attacks, and phobias.</p>
<p>A similar phenomenon is kidults (kid+adult), a term that first appeared in The New York Times in an article by journalist Peter Martin during a burst of arcade machine popularity. Kidults are people who preserve their teenage likings (from video games, anime and fantasy, to a responsibility-free lifestyle) until they are 30-35 and older. Psychologists illustrate this type with such characters as Peter Pan and the Little Prince.</p>
<h2 id="legitimation-of-infantilism" class="heading"><a href="#legitimation-of-infantilism" class="heading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for Legitimation of Infantilism" tabindex="-1"></a>Legitimation of Infantilism</h2>
<p>Some scholars argue that adulthood is no longer an unconditional value. For example, a study on attitudes among 5th-graders today revealed that they are not willing to grow up. They associate adulthood not only with independence, but also with a lot of responsibilities.</p>
<p>Young adults are in a similar situation. ‘The contradictory image of the future… frightens a young person and encourages them to stay ‘in childhood’, where there were no problems and the life was stable and safe’, Sabelnikova and Khmeleva write. It turns out that infantilism in this case is almost a conscious choice.</p>
<p>The researchers believe that infantilism should not be judged. To a certain degree, it can be considered a sign of time diversity in personal development. Lev Vygotsky used to write about similar processes.</p>
<p>«‘The personality’s path to maturity is not homogeneous by type’, say Sabelnikov and Khmeleva. Due to time diversity, in infantile people, the emotional and willpower area ‘falls behind the general development rates, and intelligence and cognition develop faster than the average in this period’.</p>
<p>‘Legitimation’ of infantilism can also be related to its assessment as a protective mechanism, a way to overcome the difficulties in life. Nancy McWilliams, a psychoanalyst from the U.S., emphasized that the term ‘infantile personality’ is disappearing from the official list, which is logical; in modern terms, it’s just an alternative life course.</p>

<p>4月20日，当埃隆·马斯克的SpaceX“星舰”在美国得克萨斯州点火发射时，身在国内的姚颂全程看了这场直播，这是这位30岁的CEO当下最关心的事情。
2021年10月，姚颂有了一个新的身份——东方空间联合创始人、联席CEO。这是一家民营火箭公司，目前已获得红杉中国、经纬中国、三一重工、米哈游等多家机构的投资。
2011年，姚颂凭借全国中学生物理竞赛奖项，保送到清华大学攻读电子工程专业，大学期间曾前往斯坦福大学访学。本科毕业后，姚颂于2016年创办深鉴科技专注AI芯片，该公司于2018年被赛灵思以3亿美元的价格收购，成为中国AI领域第一家实现退出的创业公司。
在那一次创业过程中，姚颂几乎把市面上所有的创业者奖项都拿过了，公司被收购后，他也获得一定的财务回报。更为关键的是，他收获了一种自信和安全感，他清楚地知道，任何时候去做任何事情，都没问题。
深鉴科技被收购后，姚颂兼职做了经纬中国的风险合伙人。2021年，姚颂还作为创始合伙人发起SEE Fund无限基金，关注集成电路、智能工业、新材料与新能源等领域，帮助清华大学成果转化。
一路开挂，姚颂却常常有一种时间的紧迫感：“才20多岁，肯定不能就退居二线做投资了。”这是姚颂的自我鞭策。这些年，他给自己的朋友圈签名是，“今天是生命中最年轻的一天”。
因此，在思考下一步该做什么时，姚颂给自己画了一个关于人类生存空间的抽象模型。他觉得再创业一定要做一个从人类、国家、社会角度都有意义的事情，而航天就是那个宏伟且让他激动的事儿。
姚颂从小就是航天迷和军事迷，在他很小的时候，父亲给他买了一套新世纪版12册的《十万个为什么》，姚颂最喜欢的就是《宇宙科学》分册，甚至把那册书都翻烂了。那时候，他还喜欢逛“铁血军事”论坛，并在论坛里冒充大人当版主。
过去几年，民营航天成为一个新兴创业机会，尤其在2019年星际荣耀的双曲线一号遥一火箭在酒泉卫星发射中心成功发射，将气球卫星和BP-1B卫星送入预定300公里圆轨道，实现了中国民营运载火箭零的突破，也让大家看到民营航天的可能性。
作为一个不安分的湖南人，姚颂的创业DNA再次动了起来。
2014年，国务院出台《关于创新重点领域投融资机制鼓励社会投资的指导意见》，正式打开了国内的民营火箭市场。
2020年，姚颂还在经纬中国兼职做投资。巧合的是，那时候经纬中国是投资商业航天项目最多的VC，这让姚颂对民营航天产业有了更深刻的了解。
后来，一位出身于航天世家并准备商业航天创业的同学找到姚颂。其实，这位同学找姚颂的本意是请教创业和融资，但聊完之后，对方决定邀请他一起创业。
这一切都让姚颂感到着迷，再加上难得碰到技术实力雄厚的团队，于是姚颂在2021年10月正式加入东方空间。
东方空间的技术团队大多来自长征十一号运载火箭团队，另一位联席CEO布向伟曾是长征十一号运载火箭的总体设计师，COO魏凯是长征十一号运载火箭的项目办主任。此外，CFO史圣卿，曾是无人机企业零度智控、远度科技的联合创始人与CFO。核心技术团队有着平均20余年的从业经历，曾在长征五号和多型重要战略装备型号研制中担任重要的研发负责人。
长征十一号运载火箭，是我国航天系统长征系列火箭中，主要用于商业发射的火箭。该火箭很早就发射了天仪研究院的第一颗卫星，以及国内最大民营航天公司长光卫星早期2/3的卫星。因此，东方空间团队在技术积累的同时，也具备良好的商业客户积累和商业意识。
很快，东方空间获得天使轮4亿元融资，投资方中除了红杉中国、经纬中国，还有SEE Fund以及图灵创投，更有三一集团、闻泰科技创始人张学政这样的公司和企业家。
目前，东方空间已在北京总部成立研发中心，并在陕西西安成立火箭发动机研发中心，还在山东烟台东方航天港海上发射中心建立固体火箭总装车间。
造火箭纵然很酷，可民营火箭公司有哪些机会？
《2022年中国商业航天产业投资报告》显示，2022年中国商业卫星发射数量100颗，比上年增加59颗，而与之可对比的是，马斯克的SpaceX 2022年总计将大约2000颗卫星送入了轨道。
不过，2019年底国家出台了卫星互联网规划，姚颂判断中国要大批量发射卫星，一期可能还在数百的量级，未来可能就是数千的量级了，而当下正处于像指数函数最早期的拐点位置，机遇非常大。
姚颂告诉《中国企业家》：“之所以有巨大的机会，主要因为这里面的产能、发射能力、发射价格还有巨大的空间。当前我国火箭运力和卫星发射需求是典型的错配，运力严重不足，这个事情需要发动社会力量大家一起来解决。”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>初抵四川西南的攀枝花，我们立刻感受到了与西昌截然不同的气候。湿热的空气弥漫在身边，伴随着这片土地独有的气息，为我们带来一丝新奇。</p>

<p>就在中午，我们兴致勃勃地品尝了盐边羊肉粉。据当地人介绍，这里的山羊是在山区（攀枝花盐边县附近多山）自然成长的，享受天然牧草的滋养，因而产出的羊肉鲜嫩可口。这碗羊肉粉汤浓香四溢，满口的肉香令人陶醉，充分展现了四川美食的独特风味。</p>

<p>下午时分，我们参观了位于攀枝花市的三线建设博物馆。这座博物馆以其丰富的展品和精心编排的展示，向我们展示了中国西南地区从农耕社会向现代化迈进的壮丽历程。我们充满敬意地聆听着关于三线建设背后故事的讲述，感受着如今蔚为壮观的城市化发展所带来的成果。</p>

<p>在夜晚的金沙江旁，我们静态欣赏了壮丽的夕阳。在这里，晚风从陆地吹来，形成了独特的气候现象，称为“陆风”。微凉的风轻抚着脸颊，我们感到放松而宜人。同时，金沙江的波光粼粼和河岸边的夜色交相辉映，我们沉浸在大自然的美妙之中。</p>

<p>新的一天，我们来到了会理古城。这个地方以其独特的商业布局而闻名，各种商店和购物中心错落有致地排列着，且夹杂着居住区，明宋的市井气息浓厚。商业区的规划精心设计，充分利用地理优势和交通便利性，为市民和游客提供了方便和多样选择。</p>

<p>这座古城承载着丰富的历史文化遗产，给人以时光倒流的感觉。漫步在石板路上，我们欣赏着明清时期的传统建筑风格，感受着历史的厚重。</p>
<p>通过这次旅行，我们不仅仅欣赏到了四川西南地区的自然美景，在探索中也加深了对这片土地地理特征和文化历史的理解。四川西南之行为我们打开了一扇了解地理和人文的大门，让我们更加热爱这片土地。</p>]]></content:encoded>
